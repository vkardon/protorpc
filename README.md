A header-only library providing a lightweight alternative to gRPC. It features a customizable, epoll-based networking framework (using blocking sockets for simplicity) and utilizes Protobuf for efficient data serialization. It can also be adapted for other serializers.

This project originated from the practical need to support process forking, a scenario where standard gRPC server implementations often encounter limitations due to gRPC's lack of explicit support for forking. While primarily designed for high-traffic inter-process communication (IPC) over Unix domain sockets, standard network sockets are also well-supported.
